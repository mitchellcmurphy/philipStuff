instead of a text document with 10 words try to make a test document that tests 8 cases:

if all words are the same
if there are some duplicates
if the words are in sorted order
if the words are in reverse sorted order
if some of the words are different length
if there are spaces in between the words and not line breaks
if there are numbers along with the words
if there are special characters along with the words

include expected output

Instead of 10k, 25k, 50k, 90k
Do 1k, 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, 50k, 60k, 70k, 80k, 90k

Remove anything that has to do with O1 and O2. only keep O0 and O3

Submit pre-made images, and the script to generate them (if you did a script).

You decide what should go into your BUILD, RUN, and README files.  You're trying to automate the tasks of building and running your programs as much as possible.
