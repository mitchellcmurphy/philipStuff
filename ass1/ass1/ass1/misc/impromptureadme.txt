This will prepare the programs and create a bank of input files that will be processed when you run. 
These input files are available in the input folder if you'd like to examine them beforehand. They will be wiped once the program is done running.

To run the program, type the following command
./RUN.sh

./RUNLite.sh

To run the code with your own input file, please run the following command\
./RUNMy.sh < *your input file* > *your output file
